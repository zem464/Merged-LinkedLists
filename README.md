## About the Project
**Merged Link Lists**

Data Structure and Algorithm Lab 6 exercises(Individual) Merge Linked Lists

*Lab Problem:* Merge Two Sorted Linked Lists

Description: You are given two linked lists, each representing a non-decreasingly sorted sequence of integers. The task is to merge these two linked lists into a single, sorted linked list. The new list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

*Input*

list1: the first linked list

list2: the second linked list

*Output*

A single linked list that is the result of merging list1 and list2, sorted in non-decreasing order.

Constraints:

    The number of nodes in both lists is in the range [0,50].

    -100 <= Node.value <= 100

**Example:**

*Input*

list1: 1 -> 2 -> 4

list2: 1-> 3 -> 4

*Output*

Merged List: 1 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 4

## About the Program
**STEPS**

1. Create the class for the node

2. Create the class for the linked lists and make the functions

3. With acknowledgement of the constraints, make a function to ask the user for needed inputs

4. Print the link lists and the merged link list

## Running the Program

1. Input the needed inputs

2. Run the program
